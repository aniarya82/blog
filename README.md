# This is blog based on anatole theme

Hugo is a simplistic static website genrator written in golang.

I followed from step 3 from quickstart guide and then added
- [anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole)
- [paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper)
as two themes for considerations.

Finally used submodules to host it on github pages
